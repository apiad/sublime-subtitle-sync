sublime-subtitle-sync
=====================

A tiny plugin for changing sync of subtitle files in Sublime Text.

Just select a block of text in a subtitle file, and hit:

* `ctrl+]` to increase 1 second.
* `ctrl+[` to decrease 1 second.
* `ctrl+shift+]` to increase 10 seconds.
* `ctrl+shift+[` to decrease 10 seconds.
* `ctrl+shift+alt+]` to increase 1 minute.
* `ctrl+shift+alt+[` to decrease 1 minute.

That's it!
